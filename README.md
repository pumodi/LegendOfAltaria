# LegendOfAltaria

Thank you for play testing "Legend of Altaria"

During this playtest we have a few things for you to pay attention to.
Please make notes on the following items while you play and submit them
to jeff@jeffbricemusic.com once you are finished.

1. Grammar, Spelling, etc
2. Obvious bugs (Did you get stuck in an infinite loop, did the graphics glitch out, did the game quit on you, etc)
3. Length of Playthrough (Please keep track of your play time from the moment you hit "New Game" to when you reach the end screen)
4. Balance (Did the combat feel challenging but not overly so?)
5. Were you having fun?
6. Was anything missing?
7. Anything else?
